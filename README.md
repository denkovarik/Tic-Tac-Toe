# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Introduction
This project will allow you to play the Tic-Tac-Toe game. This was the first program that I wrote back in 2016! It will allow you to play Tic Tac Toe on the command line. You can choose to play against another person or the computer (which was hard coded).

In this project, I'm hoping to improve the original program and create a bot that plays the game using a reinforcement learning algorithm. 

## Setup
This project was developed on the Window's 10 operating system. First ensure that the dependencies for the project are installed by following the tutorials in the links under the 'Dependencies' section. Then clone the repo using either HTTPS or SSH. For more information on how to clone with HTTPS, please see the section 'Cloning This Repo with HTTPS'. For more information on cloning with SSH, please see the 'Cloning This Repo with SSH' section.

### Dependencies
* Windows 10 or higher
* [MinGW GCC/G++ Compiler](https://semicolon.dev/windows/how-to-install-mingw-gcc-g-compiler-windows-10-11-2023)
* [Git](https://www.howtogeek.com/832083/how-to-install-git-on-windows/)

### Cloning This Repo with HTTPS
To download this repository on your device, you must clone this repo using either HTTPS or SSH. The easiest way to clone this repository on your local device is through HTTPS. If your SDK allows you to clone a repo through HTTPS, then do so. Otherwise, you can do it directly on the command prompt. To do so, open up the command prompt and move into the desired directory. Then simply run the following command and press Enter.

```
git clone https://github.com/denkovarik/Tic-Tac-Toe.git
```

Enter in your credentials if prompted to do so. After the repo has been cloned on your device, move into the LHC_Conversions directory from the command line.

```
cd Tic-Tac-Toe
```

### Cloning This Repo with SSH
You can also clone this repo using SSH. Follow the instructions below to clone the repo using SSH. Please note that if you have already cloned the repo using HTTPS, then you can skip to the 'Install Dependencies' step. If you wish to clone this repo using SSH, then please note that you will need an account on Github or Gitlab.

#### Generate an SSH Key Pair
In order to clone this repository, you need to add your public SSH key to this repo. If you don't have one, then you would need to generate one. [How to Generate SSH key in Windows 10? Easy Methods!!](https://www.howtogeek.com/762863/how-to-generate-ssh-keys-in-windows-10-and-windows-11/) should help you generate an SSH key pair.

#### Add Your Public SSH Key to GitHub
Once you have an SSH Key Pair generated, you need to add your public SSH key to GitHub. Follow [How to view your SSH keys in Linux, macOS, and Windows](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-view-your-ssh-keys-in-linux-macos-and-windows/) to access the public key you generated in the previous step. Then follow [Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) to add your public SSH key to GitHub.

#### Clone the Repository
If your SDK allows for it, then clone this repository through your SDK. Otherwise, open up the command prompt, move into the directory of your choice. Then run the following command.
```
git clone git@github.com:denkovarik/Tic-Tac-Toe.git
```
After the repo has been cloned on your device, move into the Bulk-Protein-Modeling directory from the command line.
```
cd Tic-Tac-Toe
```

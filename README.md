# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Introduction
This project will allow you to play the Tic Tac Toe game. This was the first program that I wrote back in 2016! It will allow you to play Tic Tac Toe on the command line. You can choose to play against another person or the computer (which was hard coded).

In this project, I'm hoping to improve the original program and create a bot that plays the game using a reinforcement learning algorithm. 

## Setup
This project was developed on the Window's 10 operating system. 

### Dependencies
* Windows 10
